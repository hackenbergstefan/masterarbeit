##Files start with `enumerationsPCN_P_`
The file `enumerationsPCN_P_p` contains the information of enumerations 
done for the prime `p`. The line `q,p,r,n,cn,pcn,gens` in 
`enumerationsPCN_P_p` shows the number of completely free (`cn`) and
completely free and primitive elements (`pcn`) in `GF(q^n)` over `GF(q)`.
`gens` gives information about the number of complete submodule generators:
`(k,t,pi):N` means that the submodule generated by the `Phi_k(x^t)^pi` 
(where `Phi_k` is the `k`-th cyclotomic polynomial) has `N` 
complete generators in `GF(q^n)` over `GF(q)`.

##Files start with `enumerationsPCN_N_`
The syntax of `enumerationsPCN_N_n` is like in the above paragraph except that 
now `n` is constant in the whole file and `q` (resp. `p` and `r`) varies.

##Files start with `PCNS_`
The file `PCNS_n` contains for every prime `p` and every extension `r` 
with `p^r < n^4` one polynomial over `GF(p)` of degree `n*r`. 
All roots of this polynomial are 
primitive and completely free elements in `GF((p^r)^n)` over `GF(p^r)`.

##Files start with `PCNS_weight_`
The file `PCNS_weight_n` contains for every prime `p` and every extension `r` 
with `p^r < n^4` one polynomial over `GF(p)` of degree `n*r`. 
All roots of this polynomial are 
primitive and completely free elements in `GF((p^r)^n)` over `GF(p^r)`.
In contrast to the above paragraph we concentrated on polynomials
with lowest hamming weigh.
