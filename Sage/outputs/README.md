##Files start with `PCNS_`
The file `PCNS_n` contains for every prime `p` and every extension `r` one
polynomial over `GF(p)` of degree `n*r`. At least `p^r` roots of this
polynomial are primitive and completely free elements in `GF((p^r)^n)` over
`GF(p^r)`.

##Files start with `enumerations_`
The file `enumerations_p` contains the information of enumerations done for 
the prime `p`. The line `q,p,r,n,cn,pcn,gens` in `enumerations_p` shows
the number of completely free (`cn`) and
completely free and primitive elements (`pcn`) in `GF(q^n)` over `GF(q)`.
`gens` gives information about the number of complete submodule generators:
`(k,t,pi):N` means that the submodule generated by the `Phi_k(x^t)^pi` 
(where `Phi_k` is the `k`-th cyclotomic polynomial) has `N` 
complete generators in `GF(q^n)` over `GF(q)`.
